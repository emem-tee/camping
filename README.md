## Introduction to Git Use

[Link to Book](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2): There are definitely better introductions to this, I would highly recommend *checking out* (haha get it? like `git checkout`) a few Youtube videos. Git is an extremely common tool. Later, we will talk about Github, but this will work for now.

I would read

- 1.1-1.6 to understand what git is,
- 2.1-2.5 to understand moving through commits (versions), and
- 3.1-3.2 to understand branches.

If you have time. Watching a youtube explainer of Git 101 and GitHub 101\* will probably do the same thing in less time.

\* Git is the software used for version control. GitHub is a website where one can host remote Git repositories.
